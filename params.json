{"name":"Fluidless","body":"# fluidLESS\r\n\r\nIs a fluid-width grid system composed out of 18 even columns utilizing LESS. Based on Joni Korpi's [Golden Grid System](https://github.com/jonikorpi/Golden-Grid-System).\r\n\r\n## File list\r\n\r\n- **example/** contains the source of the fluidLESS site.\r\n- **index.html** contains the required markup (namely the meta viewport tag) and a simple demo.\r\n- **fluid.less** is the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) stylesheet minus the variables. It offers some customization for power users, and works as a nice starting point for LESS users.\r\n- **custom.less** is the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) variables for fluid.less.\r\n- **fluid.js** contains Golden Gridlet, a script that overlays the fluidLESS grid and a baseline grid of 1.5em onto the page. Can be customized around the top of the file.
